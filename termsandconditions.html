                                    documents and images which the member decides to put online. Members

                                    intellectual property claims which might be made by a third party.
                                    All the objects, products, goods, and spaces must be placed in the
                                    appropriate category. Any Member, including you, who posts a Rental
                                    Offer (a &quot;Seller/zemoser&quot;) is solely responsible for
                                    ensuring proper category choices for their rental offers. Placement
                                    of an offer in a particular category by a Seller can in no instance
                                    be interpreted as a guarantee on Zemose’s part regarding the origin
                                    and authenticity of said rental object. A Seller must have either all
                                    ownership rights on an object, or all rights allowing them to put the
                                    object they have listed up for rent. Any material terms and
                                    conditions of a Rental Offer, including, but not limited to, cost of
                                    rental, security deposit, delivery, maintenance fees, or any
                                    additional fees, representations or warranties must be clearly
                                    indicated in the Rental Offer. Further, if any Rental Agreement is to
                                    be proposed by the Seller it must be attached to the Rental Offer.
                                    While the Rental Offer will include the Seller's city and state or
                                    province, the Seller may make no mention of personal contact
                                    information anywhere on the Rental Offer. Things that count as
                                    contact information include, but are not limited to, the physical
                                    location of the Item, the Seller’s physical address, fax, telephone
                                    number, mailing address email address, or any other way to contact
                                    the Seller outside of the Zemose interface. Zemose recommends that
                                    Sellers obtain appropriate insurance for their Rental
                                    Offers(equipment). Please review any insurance policy that you may
                                    have for your Offer and any property relating to your offering
                                    carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar
                                    with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may
                                    apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to,
                                    whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or
